1) Swap (Emergency RAM on disk)
What it is: when RAM is tight, Linux moves memory pages to disk (swap space/file).
Speed: trash compared to RAM.
Purpose: avoid immediate crash, but performance tanks.
✅ Symptoms of “swap hell”
system becomes unusably slow
high disk usage even when you’re not doing anything
“free RAM” looks low but “available” is the important part

What happens at the worst case:
If RAM is critically low and swap can’t save you: OOM Killer steps in and murders a process (sometimes your browser, sometimes your terminal, sometimes your VPN) to keep the OS alive.

How to check: (ubuntu)
free -h
vmstat 1 - In vmstat, watch these columns:
si = swap in
so = swap out
If si/so are consistently > 0 → you’re actively swapping → slowdown city.

2) Processes vs threads
Process = a running program with its own memory; thread = a worker inside that process sharing the same memory.
To see the process tree: Ubuntu: ps -ef --forest (or pstree -ap) , Windows: Task Manager
